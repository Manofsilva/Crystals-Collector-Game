# Crystals-Collector-Game

I created a fun and interactive game for web browsers. My app dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library.


# How the Game is Played:

- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game they have to match.

- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

- The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

- When they do click a crystal, the app with update the player's score counter.

```
- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
```

- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
